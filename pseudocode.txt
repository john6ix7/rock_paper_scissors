-- Rock paper scissors pseudocode -- 

# getComputerChoice algorithm 
1: Create variable ranNum that generates random number from 1-3
2: create conditional statement that will match ranNum to string if condition is true
3: IF ranNum is equal to 1 THEN
    return 'rock' to the console 
   ELSE IF ranNum is equal to 2 THEN 
    return 'paper' to the console 
   ELSE
    return 'scissors' to the console 

# playRound function
1: create variable compScore and set value = 0
2: create variable userScore and set value = 0
3: create variable playerSelection and prompt user with a selection of choices 
4: create variable computerSelection that will store the function getComputerChoice
5: create conditional statement that will compare playerSelection and computerSelection
6: IF playerSelection equals 'rock' && compares equals 'scissors THEN
    return 'you win' to the console and increment either userScore or compScore by 1
7: repeat this conditional statement for all subsequent comparisons and increments

# game function 
1: create for loop to iterate the game for 5 rounds 
2: FOR initialize variable i = 0 while i equals less than 5 increment i
3: insert playRound into for loop to play game for 5 rounds 
4: create conditional statement that will compare userScore and compScore to determine a winner
5: IF userScore > compScore THEN 
    console.log ("You win the game!")
   ELSE IF  compScore > userScore THEN 
    console.log ("You lose the game!")
   ELSE THEN
    console.log ("Tie!")
