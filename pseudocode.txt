-- Rock paper scissors pseudocode -- 

# getComputerChoice algorithm 
1: Create variable ranNum that generates random number from 1-3
2: create conditional statement that will match ranNum to string if condition is true
3: IF ranNum is equal to 1 THEN
    return 'rock' to the console 
   ELSE IF ranNum is equal to 2 THEN 
    return 'paper' to the console 
   ELSE
    return 'scissors' to the console 


# playRound function
1: create variable playerSelection and prompt user with a selection of choices 
2: create variable computerSelection that will store the function getComputerChoice
3: create function that take two parameters, playerSelection and computerSelection 
4: create conditional statement that will compare playerSelection and computerSelection
5: IF playerSelection equals 'rock' && compares equals 'scissors THEN
    return 'you win' to the console 
6: repeat this conditional statement for all subsequent comparisons
